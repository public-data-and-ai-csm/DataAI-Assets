# QRadar

This is a "landing page" for QRadar.  QRadar is the leader in Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) technology, and has been in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for the past 12 years.  By consolidating log events and network flow data from thousands of devices, endpoints and applications distributed throughout your network, QRadar correlates all this different information and aggregates related events into single alerts to accelerate incident analysis and remediation. 

## What it Does

QRadar will help customers and organizations address the following use cases:
- Detecting Advanced Threats - like abnormal connection behaviors, DNS attacks and more
- Detecting Insider Threads - from trusted users, abnormal authentication and trusted host compromise
- Securing the Cloud - watching usage, container activity, multiu-cloud attacks, and more
- Protecting Critical Data - watching for exfiltration, phishing attacks, and more
- Reponding to Alerts - endpoint detection, automated investigation and offense chaining
- Prioritizing and Managing Risks - expired accounts, network monitoring, user monitoring
