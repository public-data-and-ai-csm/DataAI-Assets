# Introduction
Once you have your Cloud Pak for Data environment all set up, you will want to put some things into place to help you do the daily administrativer tasks, as well as the monitoring and alerting to needed to make sure that your Cloud Pak is operating and supporting your users around the clock.  Some things you will need to configure once, and then just maintain.  Other thongs will need to be continuopusly maintained, and still other things need to be monitored.  Luckily, there are a lot of automated tools and techniques that make this relatively easy with the Cloud Pak for Data environment.

# Monitoring and Alerting
Once you have your Cloud Pak for Data environment all set up, you will want to make sure that it stays healthy.  What should you monitor?  How do you want to be alerted about potential issues with your Cloud Pak for Data environment?  You need to merge this monitoring and alerting capability into your existing monitoring capabilities (or create this discipline for your organization).  The health of the environment should be continuously monitored, and potntial responses to issues should be automated where possible.
