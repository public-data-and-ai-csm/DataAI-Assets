Toczala](https://github.com/dtoczala) - March 2022 - This blog post has a [Python notebook](https://github.com/public-data-and-ai-csm/Public-DataAI-Assets/blob/master/CloudPakForData/File_Manipulation_Routines.ipynb) that can be run from within Watson Studio.  You need to provide a path to your project repository.  This notebook doesn't do anything useful - but it does provide examples of how you can access project reource, files on storage volumes, and files in the VM temp space.
